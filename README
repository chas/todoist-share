Todoist-share is a Sinatra microapp for sharing your Todoist.com projects with others.

Todoist.com is a free todo list app that works pretty darn well and has some slick features. Unfortunately, it has no sharing capabilities. If you manage a list for someone else, sharing the list with that person sucks: their styles and scripts make emailing or copying/pasting really horrible. This app lets me publish the list as a read-only page at an obfuscated URL. 



Unusual Gem Dependencies:
	Sinatra
	json

To start:
 	
	1. Change the TOKEN to your Todoist.com API key (found under Preferences > Account)
	
	2. Change SUPER_SECRET_HASH to whatever string you want, if you care.

	3. ruby share.rb
	
	4. And open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:4567/
